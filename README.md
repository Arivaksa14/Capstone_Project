# Capstone_Project
Welcome to Final Capstone Project for CS 112.
Our idea is creating an app for a non-profit animal shelter where people have an ability to adopt pets, bring them to the shelter as well as donate to the organization.
You may find the project requirements here: [CS 112_Capstone.docx](https://github.com/Arivaksa14/Capstone_Project/files/8648709/CS.112_Capstone.docx)
